# GCP-with-Node

Demonstration of building a Google Cloud Platform project with Node.js

This repo collects the artifacts--source code, documentation--of my journey
to learn how to build a Node.js application on
[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com).

In my travel log files, I assume the point-of-view of a brand new
GCP developer. As I go along, I will make sure to cite my sources and try
to explain as much as I can.

To begin following my journey, see [The Journey Begins](journey/overview.md).

## Before you begin

If you decide to try this code yourself, you should:

  * Have some familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js
