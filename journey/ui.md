# Designing the user interface

Over time, I plan to build a multi-part web application that interacts with
different parts of GCP.

For the first part of my web app, I want to create a simple translation app,
something that integrates Google Cloud Translate. I just want to
create a simple UI. The UI will allow users to specify a source and target
language, provide simple text, and send a request to my app. My app responds
by sending the translation back.

To build this, I'll create a `TranslationModule` that encapsulates this
part of my app.

## Defining routes

With the routing module added to my app, I can define my routes as I build
out my app. I'm going to start by creating a '/translation' route.

In my [app-routing.module.ts]() file, I add the following code:

```
// ...

import { TranslationComponent } from './translation/translation.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'translation', component : TranslationComponent },
];

// ...

```

## Creating the TranslationComponent

Thankfully, the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli/generate) makes the next
step really easy. I run the following command to create the component:

```
ng generate component
```

The tool asks me what I want to name my component during the building process--I
give it the name "Translate." In just a few moments, the tool finishes building
the [Translation module](../project/ng-src/src/app/translation/),
including adding the correct `import` statements to my
[`app.module.ts`](../project/ng-src/src/app/app.module.ts) file.

At this point, I can run my app locally to verify that it works. Since I
haven't made any server-side changes, I can run the app using `ng serve`.

## Adding material to my app

Angular works really well with Material design components. I can import
the components into my app and they look really nice out-of-the-box.

For my translation app design, I really only need the following components:

  * Two drop-downs for the language selectors
  * A textbox for the input
  * A button to send the request to my app
  * A label to display the output

I can probably use a plain old `div` for the label, so I don't need to worry
about that. I do need to import the Material components for a drop-down,
a textbox, and a button.

### Importing Angular Material

From the root of my Angular app, I run `ng add @angular/material`. The
Angular CLI then asks me some configuration questions and then updates my app
I decide on the Purple/Amber theme.

Note: The CLI will ask you if you want HammerJS and animations in your app. Unless you know what youâ€™re doing, yes, you want these in your app. Not including them will cause some of the material components to not work correctly.

## Building the user interface

As mentioned earlier, I'm going to include two drop-downs, a text fields, and
a button in my user interface. Thus, I'm going to import the `MatButtonModule`
`MatInputModule`, and `MatSelectModule` modules into my app.

Of course, I want to be able to access the data in the form fields of my user
interface. To do this, I used
[Angular reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms). For my
UI, I needed to use the `FormGroup` and `FormControl` classes from the
`ReactiveFormsModule`.

### Adding imports to the app module

I updated the [`app.module.ts`](../project/ng-src/src/app/app.module.ts)
file with the following code to import the modules I need:

```
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatFormFieldModule } from '@angular/material/form-field';
import { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';
import { MatSelectModule } from '@angular/material/select';

import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  ...,
  imports: [
    ...
    MatButtonModule,
    MatFormFieldModule,
    MatInputModule,
    MatSelectModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
  ],
  ...
})

```

### Defining the HTML interface

I created a rather simple UI with a `form` tag that includes the other
form fields. This helps me to access the data from the fields in the form
from a reference to the form itself.

You can see the final version of the HTML interface
[here](../project/ng-src/src/app/translation/translation.component.html).

### Adding the behavior of the interface

In the TypeScript code file for my Translation module, I create a new
instance of the `FormGroup` class and assign it to a variable. The
variable must match the value that I provided for the `[formGroup]`
attribute of the form in `translation.component.html`.

Each of the child controls is created as an instance of the `FormControl`
class. The field name of each control must match the `formControlName`
attribute of each field in the HTML.

Because of how I defined the individual child controls in my form, I can
access their values elsewhere in my `TranslationComponent` class.

```
  languages: Language[] = [
    { value: 'en-US', displayName: 'English (US)' },
    { value: 'fr-FR', displayName: 'French (France)' }
  ];

  sourceLang: string = '';
  targetLang: string = '';
  translationForm: FormGroup;
  translationText: string = '';

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.translationForm = new FormGroup({
        sourceLang: new FormControl(''),
        targetLang: new FormControl(''),
        translationText: new FormControl(''),
      });
  }

  updateOutput() {
    const translationFormValue: any = this.translationForm.value;
    this.result = `Source language: ${translationFormValue.sourceLang};`;
    this.result += `Target language: ${translationFormValue.targetLang};`;
    this.result += `Text to translate: "${translationFormValue.translationText}";`;
  }
```

## Next

With the UI put together, I can build the
[Angular service that calls my server's REST API method](ng-service.md).
